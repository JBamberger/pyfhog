# PyFHoG - Python wrapper for Felzenszwalb et al.'s HOG feature extractor

This package is a tiny wrapper around the fhog function from Piotr Dollar's
Matlab toolbox. The package provides a single method to compute the HOG from a
numpy array.

## Installation

The package is not available from PyPI but can be installed directly from the
git repository as follows:

```sh
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/JBamberger/pyfhog.git
```
